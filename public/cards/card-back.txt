Card back image placeholder.

The card-back.svg file contains a scalable vector version of the card back.
For production use, this should be converted to a PNG at 1024x1024 resolution.

You can convert it using:
- Online tools like CloudConvert or Convertio
- Command line: inkscape card-back.svg --export-png=card-back.png --export-width=1024 --export-height=1024
- Or use any image editing software that supports SVG

For now, the game will use the sleeve color as a fallback for card backs.
